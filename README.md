# Python Examples for Qt

Just a repository that contains examples in [Python](https://www.python.org) for the
[Qt](https://www.qt.io) framework.

This repository contains a copy of the examples of
[PyQt6](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt) and
[PySide6](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python).  Look at the file headers for the corresponding license.
Notice the examples are installed with PySide6 but not for PyQt6.

[Qt examples](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtexamples.html) are installed with the Qt installer.
