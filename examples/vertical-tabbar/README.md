# QML Vertical TabBar

This QMl file show how to hack and make a **TabBar** vertical.

Actually, this example has the following issues:

* fitst item can be partially clipped (flickable issue ?)
* a separator line is painted. Where it comes from ???

**Notice, QtQuick Controls2 are a mix of C++ and QML**
